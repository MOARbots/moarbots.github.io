{"name":"MOARbots","tagline":"Modular, Open-Source, Affordable Robots","body":"### Welcome to MOARbots, the Modular, Open-Source, Affordable Robots project.\r\nThis framework aims to provide a set of designs, code, ideas, and documentation to aid in the construction of sets of robots that are:\r\n* Modular and highly reconfigurable - all mechanical designs are parametrically defined by code and rendered in tools such as OpenSCAD.\r\n* Open-source -  All components of the framework are released as open-source and all existing tools leveraged by the framework are open source.\r\n* Affordable - under $50 per robot, with some designs costing much less. Current functional prototypes cost between $50 - $75, and a new design in development is targeting the $35 price point.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/MOARbots/moarbots.github.io/blob/master/images/IMG_7743.JPG?raw=true)\r\n\r\nIn addition, MOARbots:\r\n* Are designed to be made with 3d printed plastic, and/or with easy to source parts, such as nails, rubber bands, marbles, hot glue, and heat shrink.\r\n* Feature a wireless radio, so that robots can be used in many applications, including:\r\n  * Overhead camera based autonomous navigation\r\n  * Distributed multi-agent systems\r\n  * Remote control\r\n  * Small enough to run multiple robots in a standard arena whose size is defined by the field of view of a typical USB webcam mounted on the ceiling of a standard room\r\n\r\n### Repositories\r\nCheck out the different repositories that make up this project at [github.com/MOARbots](https://github.com/MOARbots/)\r\n\r\n### Project Creator\r\n* @eshira\r\n\r\n### Project Volunteers\r\n* @ArchimedesPi\r\n* @handihans\r\n* @lcchu\r\n* @amcolash\r\n\r\nDo you want to work on this project with us?
