{"name":"MOARbots","tagline":"Modular, Open-Source, Affordable Robots","body":"### Welcome to MOARbots, the Modular, Open-Source, Affordable Robots project.\r\nThis framework aims to provide a set of designs, code, ideas, and documentation to aid in the construction of sets of robots that are:\r\n* Modular and highly reconfigurable - all mechanical designs are parametrically defined by code and rendered in tools such as OpenSCAD.\r\n* Open-source -  All components of the framework are released as open-source and all existing tools leveraged by the framework are open source.\r\n* Affordable - under $50 per robot, with some designs costing much less. That cost estimate includes ALL parts, including batteries. It does not include the external elements of the framework such as a webcam and server.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/MOARbots/moarbots.github.io/blob/master/images/IMG_7743.JPG?raw=true)\r\n\r\nIn addition, MOARbots:\r\n* Are designed to be made with 3d printed plastic, and/or with easy to source parts, such as nails, rubber bands, marbles, hot glue, and heat shrink.\r\n* Feature a wireless radio, so that robots can be used in many applications, including:\r\nOverhead camera based autonomous navigation\r\n    * Distributed multi-agent systems\r\n    * Remote control\r\n    * Small enough to run multiple robots in a standard arena whose size is defined by the field of view of a typical USB webcam mounted on the ceiling of a standard room\r\n\r\n### Repositories\r\nCheck out the different repositories that make up this project at [github.com/MOARbots](https://github.com/MOARbots/)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* @eshira\r\n* @ArchimedesPi\r\n* @handihans\r\n* @lcchu\r\n* @amcolash","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
